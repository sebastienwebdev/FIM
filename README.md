<h2>Description</h2>
This beginner-friendly project delves into the creation of a basic File Integrity Monitor (FIM) using Python, aimed at safeguarding the integrity of data by monitoring file changes. Emphasizing the core principle of integrity from the CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—this guide underscores the importance of maintaining data consistency and accuracy. The FIM system developed here alerts administrators to unauthorized alterations, ensuring data remains untampered and secure.
